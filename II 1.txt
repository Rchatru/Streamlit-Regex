let me introduce i think it's a great opportunity for for us
0:17
for this phd program to have the presence of anna pereira
0:23
she's a professor at the department of mathematics and polytechnic institute of
0:30
braganza i want to to do to say this because this phd program has a
0:38
collaboration with agreement with this institute and it's a very good opportunity to make
0:45
a mobility uh in order to to access the
0:50
international accreditation of the of the thesis so i think this is a very good
0:56
opportunity to know something about the the research that they are doing at the ipb in portugal
1:05
so anna is the this coordinator of the research center in digitalization and
1:12
intelligent robotic setting easier etc
1:17
so her seminar today is about the optimization and learning algorithms
1:25
so anna your shot thanks a lot
1:30
santiago so first of all thanks for the invitation and to participate in the seminar okay
1:38
um what i did when you invite me was to first very few fly
1:45
slides about where it is bregenza and where it is every okay
1:50
because like that you are local uh ourselves and after okay we will speak a little
1:57
bit about what our team is then on optimization and learning algorithms
2:04
what we really like is to combine algorithms and to discover a new
2:09
approach to to solve the problems okay so i will share my presentation
2:33
it is so
2:39
uh my name is anna so of course in 15 minutes 20 minutes is not possible to explain a lot
2:46
about optimization and learning algorithms but the most important thing here is that you have an idea what we do
2:53
and what kind of algorithms that we work and if you have any doubts please send
2:59
um an email to iprada at ippointpt or saturday at ipv point pt
3:06
and we can discuss more and see other approaches and we can
3:12
collaborate in a different ways for now just an overview what we do and
3:17
what kind of applications that we are working on
3:22
so brian's the first celery sergey is located in vegas city
3:28
and cedric is one of the higher of research center from ipv against the polytechnic
3:36
institute this institute has four research centers
3:41
two of them simu and sadly has the higher level mark in terms of research
3:47
in portugal so we have we were evaluated the last two years ago as excellent and the next
3:54
evaluation will be the next year and for sure that we will get the same mark
4:00
because we are trying to continue our job so we are in the northeast of
4:06
um of portugal very near of spain so we usually say that we are more near of
4:12
europe than the other cities in portugal so it is very easy we are 15 kilometers
4:18
from spain to have an idea uh and it is very common to have a lot of tourism of spanish students that
4:26
visit our city what we do in cedric sadly as santiago
4:33
said is research center in digitalization and intelligent robotics
4:39
what we do is to develop and apply knowledge in terms of intelligent systems robotics and ict
4:46
in order to digitalization and optimization of industrial systems
4:52
and we try to apply this kind of strategy in several areas in particular
4:58
in the industry innovation and in companies that are located in regions of
5:05
low population and economy density we have a lot of applications in
5:10
manufacturing agrofood and others as you see in brief
5:17
i have here a video only to show you
5:23
uh our institution and where it is our facilities
5:29
so we are working in the school of
5:34
technology and management we have
5:39
six labs some of them only associated to innovation
5:50
we have research from mathematics informatics
5:57
electronics [Music] and
6:03
what we will try is to apply several new approaches innovative approach to to
6:09
solve several problems we have some demonstrations to when we have some visits
6:15
company visits and so on
6:20
[Music]
6:26
do
6:35
[Music] so this is
6:41
going to have an idea of what we are doing in
6:46
this the material that we are we are working on so nowadays nowadays we have
6:53
23 senior research from these three areas that i told so informatics electoral electronic electronics and
7:00
mathematics we have 39 phd students uh
7:06
all these phd students they are doing the phd in other universities so because poetic
7:11
institute is not allowed yet to get the phd program so we we have
7:17
these kind of protocols that we have with laguna to where the students take the degree in
7:24
other institution but uh the all the work or most of the work is done here it
7:29
is a great opportunity also to collaborate with other institutions
7:34
we have 37 fellowship research so people that are not yet in a phd but for sure
7:40
that we'll get there this year in 2022 we have 23 ongoing
7:46
projects and with a budget of 3.6 million during these uh four years 20
7:52
and 23 and for sure that we want to increase this budget so if you have more if you have if you
7:59
want to explore a little bit more about cedric we have here the website sadly point ipv
8:04
point pt we have facebook instagram everything so you can see our what we are doing
8:11
here all the projects that are we we are involved and you can have a better
8:16
idea what we do about the topic that i will speak today
8:22
that is the optimization research group um this group it is a subgroup in cedric
8:28
we have we are five senior research me as a leader um in this group
8:35
nine phd students ten ongoing projects and five fellowships research
8:40
and what we do is to develop algorithms and new approach that combine optimization and machine learning for
8:47
decision support so some ideas of what we do and we do
8:53
from the the basis until the applications and it is a an
8:58
overview of everything some examples for example about the response surveys method this
9:05
response surveys method is a method that mining process and a chemical process use a lot
9:13
to design match to design experience this is a problem that is characterized
9:20
as a non-linear single objective means that it is only one objective
9:26
problem but is nonlinear um we define these response surveys based
9:33
on predefined reduced set experience the idea is to calculate the optimal
9:40
identifying the new experience we have also some static statistical analysis for this model
9:47
model coefficients and this we improve this response service method in order to be dynamic
9:56
so the results that we get until now is that for example when we compare our
10:01
approach with tagushi method that is the traditional one the tagushi method needs for sure to to
10:09
do 16 experience in this case of four parameters
10:15
and in our case with 10 experience we already get a better result than tagushi
10:21
method when we apply for example in chemical process chemical context
10:28
the traditional research response service method
10:33
we need 28 experience and with our approach we have between 15 and 18
10:39
experience what that means that means that the research gets
10:45
faster the correct the the optimal answer they do not expend so many costs to
10:51
to have this experience and they get the better value with a low
10:58
amount of money and the load time so this is very interesting and we have
11:03
this method already available that the community can use
11:09
another project that we are involved that you will finish this year is to censor the the flores to identify
11:17
the forest ignitions and for that we have that were developed
11:23
here in the century two types of sensors and we want to
11:29
found where we should locate these sensors in order to get
11:34
a more higher to reduce the higher fire risk index
11:41
for that we use the genetic algorithm so our group using usually work with
11:47
populational methods but not limits we do it in a sequential and parallel
11:53
using matlab and c plus plus and this is an example what we get so this
12:00
is a real example that where we apply in black it is the street um
12:07
red it is one type of sensors like the another one and what we
12:12
notice this is a multi-global problem what that means means that have a lot of
12:18
global solutions so we have a lot of opportunities here to combine and test
12:25
several solutions this is a combinatory problem and it's a problem with
12:31
constraints and when we do the optimization um
12:36
we can reduce the fire risk index in 40 percent
12:42
now we are using the multi-objective techniques to identify the buried front
12:47
pareto front is a set of solutions where
12:52
minimize a set of objective functions
12:59
what we also do is these sensors that we locate in forests and communicate with
13:04
ipv with the lora system they measure the temperature the
13:10
humidity and fire flame and we are using the kappa means for the classification methods and decision tree
13:17
and cvm that were the best ones that we already test until now to predict the temperature the humidity
13:26
and uh to declassify if uh that point in the forest have a fire on auto fire
13:34
this application will be used by the firemen here in bregenza so we are
13:41
in this year will be available for them and it is in collaboration with them
13:48
another project that we are involved with the university of menu also in the north of portugal
13:55
is the 3d printer so we are trying to minimize in 3d printer the support area
14:03
the part building time and straight effect for that we already test a lot of
14:09
approaches because this project was finished the last year and we use
14:16
genetic algorithm electromagnetism algorithm like the non-dominant genetic
14:21
algorithm and we find solutions that are obtained by harvest optimization and we can prove
14:29
that after we print that our solution the the angle of of printing um get a better
14:36
pieces in 3d printer
14:42
we also work in planning routes so this is a case of uh drone uh you uh
14:50
and on so this is a case of drone so imagine that we have a key set of drones
14:56
that i want to discover unknown uh area for example for a rest or something like
15:03
that so in this case uh we use different metrics to coordinate the key say key
15:10
ceptrons we explore the a-star and distro techniques
15:16
and we get a very interesting results in particularly with a star
15:22
where we can identify a very nice route with unknown areas to be discovered
15:32
we also use the planning routes for example in applications
15:38
for people to identify the best routes for individual with reduced mobility
15:46
so blind situations or or if they are in the wells uh for
15:51
example and for that we are working with municipalities in the north of portugal
15:57
where we can characterize each part of the street and we can find the best route for them
16:05
to to to travel uh in a given city with this result so this is vienna plus
16:12
this is an app that is already available in the app store so with this um approach we are using
16:20
the a a-star method that get the better results in a very few times so in the
16:27
second in milliseconds we have the root and it is working quite well
16:33
now what we are doing is to explore this approach with multi-objective techniques imagine
16:39
that the the person can select a settle a set of criterias and i can
16:45
select my path in terms of accessibility for example and slope
16:52
and the path will change considering the the set of
16:57
the set of characterizations in this case we use the a star combined with chebychev's colorization to
17:04
identify the parade front and it is that solution of brett front that appear here in this in the app
17:14
so this is some example as you can see when i change the slope
17:19
the path also will change oops
17:26
another problem that we are working in particularly with laguna so smart breed optimization
17:33
it is so the idea is to resu to reduce the energy builds by reducing also the
17:40
gas emission we already explored a little bit this problem and we use simplex method
17:47
genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization also in a multi-objective
17:54
problem as using parrot search algorithm and until now we have very satisfactory
18:01
uh results using an hybrid method that combines simplex and simplex method with
18:07
particle swarm optimization that was implemented here with bayer
18:12
that is also a phd in this month in this phd program
18:18
and like that we have a reduce of money in the costs of the build and also
18:25
in the gas emission
18:32
other situation is for example the location of the scheduling of resources
18:40
so we also work on this for example to minimize the total time of home visits and travel of the nurse
18:47
of home home visits by the nurse these ones are in collaboration with the
18:52
hospital here in gregenster we also use a lot of algorithms and of course always
18:59
usual usually is this situation that we have an hybrid solution that
19:04
gets the better results in this case with genetic algorithm and simplex and this method for example is now
19:12
applied in the hospital of braganza and we want to apply now in the
19:17
environments because they also have a problem of scaling and we want to to
19:23
work with them in this case um we are also work in predicting models
19:31
in retail area for example in the case of son isola is a big group here that
19:37
has his owner of continent model stores and we are working
19:44
with elaborate predict method to identify when we can cause an accident
19:50
for the collaborators and like that to get more attention this is an ongoing work until now we
19:58
already have a very good results but will only end in the next year
20:06
um one of very new projects that we are now in our hands is the mathy pixel amati
20:14
pro mati project this smarty was a platform that we developed to promote math and
20:20
optimization it is running since 2019
20:26
have until now uh more than 1 000 of students and very a
20:33
lot of institutions you if you want you can use this this um
20:38
website it is uh free of charge and you can use to learn math and optimization
20:44
but we want to get further and now we have a new project that was approved this year e-math where we want to
20:51
develop an intelligent system to support the learning activities of this platform
20:57
and for that we need to identify so this is in the area of learning analytics
21:02
so we want to measure the learning activity of the given student and adapt using using an intelligent algorithm to
21:12
identify how we can maximize the student engagement how we can give more support to the teachers and so
21:19
on and finally because i
21:25
i think that i'm in my time i also want to invite you because hearing portugal
21:30
and cedric always organize a conference in optimization and learning algorithms and applications
21:36
um and this is the website is all to a point ipv point pt and if you want to
21:43
submit your works in these areas please feel free we are always um welcome and this is
21:50
another opportunity to share knowledge and so on and these are
21:55
the presentation and the guys that are working now in the series
22:01
in the setting in the optimization group only i hope they like me on time
22:07
a little bit more sorry
22:15
as you see here the idea is to only to show a little bit what we do because we we do a lot of kind of different
22:22
approaches and if you want to know more about the algorithms uh you are totally free you
22:29
have my email i okay i will put here in chat and anyone can contact us and we are
22:35
always welcome because we really like to collaborate so we usually say we do not do nothing
22:41
without problems so the problems arise and we are here to try to solve it
22:48
thanks so much thanks so much for that and and for the first part of your
22:53
presentation because this was very clear about to make an idea about your your work
23:00
where you are and where you're doing and and the second part
23:06
all the all the projects involved in your group so
23:14
that that was is one thing that we are characterizing institute protect of braganza we are one of the institutions
23:22
in portugal with a higher uh higher percentage of international
23:27
students so until now we have 36 international students in our
23:33
community so you can imagine that is a lot so that the yaya is one of these cases
23:39
uh so we are working now with more than 60 countries and we are always receive
23:46
international students here so it is a very international school
23:52
okay okay thank you so much so now is the time for questions so any question for
24:00
to anna
24:05
i can add one thing uh as you see um
24:11
i present here a lot of problems totally different and this is what i really like to to check that this the most
24:18
interesting thing is that everything is the same basis
24:23
and so we can apply for mobility we can apply for
24:29
industrial we can apply for retail we can apply for more fundamental areas for example the
24:36
3d printer but the basics are the very this is what i really like is go to the basic and
24:43
solve the basis the the the the front end that you see it is different
24:49
but the basic basis is uh very similar and this is what we really like
24:56
yeah yeah i think a lot of our students are very very near to these techniques for
25:04
example people are working on robotics and they are working on mobile robotics and
25:10
the path planning planning rooms yeah they are very very near to this to this approach uh
25:17
with the a they start algorithms or supported by the mrt machine or
25:24
so on so i think i don't know if if they have a
25:30
question for you but if they don't reset if they don't do not
25:36
know have an idea of doubts they can always send an email yeah and i
25:42
usually say if you don't if you don't uh if i do not answer send again
25:49
okay okay okay thank you so much do you hand it up
25:55
yes hi anna and thank you so much for your present
26:00
presentation i wanted to know uh which library
26:07
you use or your investigating investigation group use in the case of
26:13
genetic algorithms or deep learning in your projects okay in terms of genetic algorithms
26:21
uh we have uh our own uh in the case of c plus plus we are it it is our okay it was
26:28
developed by us because we have in a sequential mode and also in parallel modes
26:35
so it to be a to have a comparation it was us at develop okay in c plus plus
26:42
in the terms of um python because we also work with python
26:47
we use uh paimu and pai omu so it is a very nice
26:53
optimization tool libraries and we also collaborate with them
26:59
to in some algorithms and it is available
27:05
we are also work in matlab in the case of matlab we have already
27:10
some methods development for example the electromagnetism like nga we have npso but
27:18
we also use that are already available on matlab and what we write we really
27:24
like is to compare because the trick of the optimization is to adapt always
27:31
the algorithm to this to the problem and of course when you use this is the trick
27:36
always so when you use uh an algorithm for matlab for example
27:43
that gets some results good but when you adapt the algorithm to the problem you
27:49
get much better results and this is what we do here so we always compare with it is already
27:56
available in python in matlab or in c plus but after we do always adaptations to
28:04
improve or in terms of time or in terms of
28:10
of function evaluation or in terms of costs or in terms of
28:16
precision or in terms of robust so what we do is like that always adapt
28:22
because we know we already know what are the trickies of the algorithms and we put some
28:29
as i said okay now we're going to get really uh a diversion okay
28:35
because when we go there and choose the parameters better for that particularly problem that like that it is perfect
28:43
yeah thank you so much you're welcome thank you you said that's mine
28:52
uh see hello uh professor anna i want to thank you first for for your clear
28:59
presentation um i have a question about um the project of uh smart grid i want to know
29:07
did you work on real data i mean do you have a prototype or you worked on
29:13
a real project we have we work in uh
29:18
we work with the real letter but yeah yeah we can also explain that part because it was one of the
29:25
students that work on that and we work on real data we have some data
29:32
here in bregenza because we have some solar panels and
29:39
either some win parameters and so on so we have some data here
29:45
um and we use not only the date of rpp but also
29:51
some data that we because eia is from argelia and they have already some data there
29:57
so we use some real data okay that's good so you worked on on the
30:02
whole level like from the energy uh generation until the distribution
30:08
yeah okay and what we um uh want to do to build now is to have a
30:15
platform where the research can update the data and get some feedback about the optimization
30:22
that's good thank you so much you're welcome thank you this is a very good question because the
30:29
fourth seminar of today you can you can get some more information about
30:35
the the local work here about this topic uh yahya has
30:42
no stand up hello uh first thank you professor for your presentation
30:48
uh i won't just uh answer two questions about the the smart grid
30:53
uh the idea is that uh first uh in the first phase of the this
30:58
kind of project of smart grid is going like from uh like to do the energy management is
31:04
doing well sizing of the of the of the smart grid the first step that we've done is that to have uh already existed
31:12
data we do just an energy management of one microgrid and when we get like the
31:17
uh the performance of algorithms when we test uh some algorithms for example
31:23
particle swarm optimization and we we test like two or three uh type of particle swarm optimization and
31:29
when we combine strategies we get the best solution getting the best solution we go back to the to the sizing and in
31:36
this phase we have done like a data from braganza and data from
31:41
algeria we have developed like an application in matlab with upgrade of
31:47
of matlab that is intended for doing the sizing of the microgrid
31:52
and when getting like the optimal sizing of microgrid using also optimization algorithm based on evolutionary
31:58
optimization algorithm we tell we test another time this algorithm with this adapted data and like
32:05
uh also the effectiveness of algorithms uh was satisfied
32:11
yeah everything was clear thank you so much welcome
32:18
[Music] okay i think we are now out of time yeah i
32:24
don't want to to to wait more for the next presentation so
32:29
any question for anna can send can be sent to to to email
32:36
uh to the email of of an aberdeen okay so anna thank you so much
32:42
you're welcome
